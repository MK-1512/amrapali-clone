    fullBio: `With a penchant for art and creativity, Jaya, has been putting her heart at the right place since her good old childhood days. Be it knitting or stitching, singing or painting she has not just done it all, but also mastered each of them with great flair and finesse. But life comes with its own challenges. Amidst juggling the duties as a wife and mother, her passions momentarily took a backseat, although she continued her lessons in weaving, crochet, embroidery, macramé, batik, bandhani and participating in several art and craft exhibitions.

Gradually, Jaya started painting sarees on her free afternoons once again, and it was then that she first nurtured the dream of channelizing her creativity into something more vivid and meaningful, something that would align her passion with a purpose, something that would allow her to touch the lives of people and make a difference, however small or big. The best part is, she did not leave that dream to be buried under a ‘what if’, filled with regret. She chose to give it a shape and make it come alive. And that is precisely how Amrapali was born.

After a successful stint of running a make-shift store at home for a couple of years, at the age of fifty-two, Jaya finally opened the doors to her very own brick and mortar retail store – Amrapali Boutique, with the encouragement and support from her loved ones and well-wishers; but mostly with her own courage and self-belief. She is an inspiration to many, reiterating the fact in the truest sense, that it's never too late to pursue your dreams.`

    fullBio: `Shreya is the one, who by a sheer stroke of serendipity kick-started the social media presence of Amrapali, in the form of Facebook and Instagram pages many moons ago; partly out of boredom and mostly out of curiosity. Little did she know that going forward, this inadvertent plan of action, would be a major milestone and the ultimate game-changer in the journey of Amrapali.
The amount of love, appreciation and support that poured in from people all across the world in no time, was reason enough to fuel her passion and motivate Shreya to take this up with all her heart and soul, alongside her already existing career in the Media and Entertainment industry, in a different city!

As challenging as it might be today, she manages to juggle between both cities and give in to both her pursuits with equal diligence and enthusiasm. From handling the social media pages, to donning the hat of a content-writer, from being a part of the photoshoots with her sister Shramona, to churning out sales and business strategies and from building online customer relationships to seeking new ways to expand the product portfolio; Shreya strives to attain the perfect balance between creativity and commerce.
Looks like it was an interesting serendipity, after all. :)

    fullBio: `Shramona, known to many of you as @mishti.and.meat on Instagram is a travel and lifestyle blogger by profession. But when you are endowed with different skills, talents and interests, why stick to just one? And being the multi-faceted, bundle of energy that she is, she balances both and how!

She’s one of our in-house models who makes each and every saree that she dons, come to life. Having a fetish for photography just as much, she is the one behind the lenses as well, for our jewellery photoshoots.

On days when she's not on her solo trips, you'll find her accompanying Jaya, her mother, to source and curate the magical six yards from different parts of the country. Despite being the youngest member of Team Amrapali, her contribution is invaluable.

    fullBio: `Soma is the forewoman of Amrapali.
With a pleasing personality and a strong flair for fashion and aesthetics, she has the superpowers to handle every kind of customer at the store and cater to their varied needs. That apart, Soma is the one in-charge of operations, that include processing payments, handling cash registers, noting down the shipping logistics correctly, managing the accounts, keeping a record of daily inventory totals, checking balances and well, everything in between.
On her not-so-hectic days, Soma is also found painting or crafting some beautiful embroidery on our lovely six yards, at the store. Didn’t we say, she has superpowers?`

    fullBio: `Sayantani is the first member of Team Amrapali and has been a part of this wonderful journey,
right from the onset.
With a great eye for visual representation, she is the one to set up the store’s window displays. Our figurines are always beautifully decked and highlighted with the innate expertise of Sayantani. Besides that, she’s in charge of keeping a check on all online bookings and maintaining a tab on the inventory. Hand-embroidery is something which she takes a keen interest in and on her free days, you’ll find Sayantani indulging in the skills of the stitches.
Last, but not least, she also lends her helping hand during our photoshoots in unfolding, folding and doing a through quality check on each of our sarees.
And all of this, with that radiant, unwavering smile of hers. :)`

    fullBio: `Gouri, with her ever charming and amiable personality is always ready to attend customers at the store with a smile on her lips and a great deal of patience in her heart. Albeit a fairly soft-spoken person, she finds true enjoyment in identifying customers’ needs, guiding them to the right shelves, answering their queries, making style suggestions, providing honest feedback if asked for and assisting the customers throughout the purchasing procedure to give them a memorable shopping experience.
In addition to that, Gouri is an expert in 'Kantha' stitch too and also assists the rest of the team in executing the nitty gritty of online dispatches.
A perfect example of action speaks louder than words.`

    fullBio: `The only man amidst an all women brigade, Nayan, is our Man Friday.
Right from maintaining a clean and organized appearance of the store to running errands, to doing several rounds of chai, pakodas and jhalmudi (spicy puffed rice) sessions, Nayan is always on his toes.
He is in charge of the accessories section at the store and happily assists the customers for putting together a desired look. Amidst handling the in-store responsibilities, he is also the one who carefully scrutinizes each saree and packages them with care for online dispatches. The word ‘no’ simply doesn’t exist
in his dictionary. 
Nayan is undoubtedly the most indispensable part of Amrapali. `
