Needless to say, women are fierce and independent, bold and undaunted. Women never failed to capture the spirit of progress ushering a brave new world. From our grandmas to moms to sisters to female teachers to girlfriends, the women in our lives have always fueled our zest to do something while striving for excellence. They know what makes each of their family members happy, they know the perfect blend of spices to cook that oh-so-yummy dish, they make huge projects happen at their workplaces and they always know what is where in the house, always! Every woman breaks the glass ceiling of fears everyday in some way. Their strength and enthusiasm is infectious and influential.' },

She said that she learnt it as a child by asking her mother to keep some extra dough for her in the end, enough for one ‘roti’ and that is how she mastered the art of roti-making, little by little. She learnt sewing, stitching, knitting, putting buttons on her brothers’ shirts, all the same way.

Oh, I was quite a troublesome kid. Coming back from school, had I not got the sight of my mother, I used to throw a lot of tantrums. What I perhaps thought was love and attachment, is quite embarrassing, and can admittedly be called annoying now. So well, with housework, two kids and an entire family to take care of, she gradually stopped pursuing those dreams. But she continued living them through colorful sweaters that she would knit for us and helping with our SUPW homework from school. I recall, at the age of thirteen, right before the Christmas party in school, bandanas were in trend. I didn’t know where to buy them from so she knitted three of those for me. The entire school was in awe. But well, apart from the joyous thank you’s and zealous hugs, not much appreciation came her way, and maybe she wasn’t looking for much too.

So she decided to press on the rewind button and bring back her dreams that had been lying unattended for a long time. And that is when Amrapali was born. She turned our drawing room into a makeshift store and that’s how she started Amrapali. She started sourcing different sarees from weavers of small villages, self-painted and embroidered on some of them and started selling her curated pieces. My sister and I whole-heartedly supported her in this new quest but since we were far away from home, she singlehandedly managed it all. It was only her determination and dedication that led to the onset of Amrapali. Admittedly, there were not a lot of customers to begin with; not to mention the multiple challenges that came along. Back then, people were not exposed much to the idea of purchasing from small, home-grown businesses. That apart, not many people knew about it in the first place and on most days there were no customers at all. The location of our house being in a quiet cul-de-sac, didn\'t aid much in the process too.

She worked all day, managing home and business meticulously, shifting between her identities of that of a mother, wife, an entrepreneur and the woman of the house at ease. Slowly my sister and I joined in. Her energy was too infectious to not catch onto and perhaps that is what made us fall in love with sarees and the art of selling them. We took Amrapali online, first on Instagram and then with all the love and appreciation we received worldwide, together we dared to dream bigger as we opened our website on 15th August 2019.
