              <h4>Product Photography & Color Accuracy</h4>
              <p>
                We try our best to capture product photos under natural light to
                ensure they resemble what you see on the website. However,
                variations can occur due to lighting, digital photography,
                and device display differences. These discrepancies are natural
                and unavoidable. We request customers to consider this before
                placing orders.

              <h4>Handcrafted Product Disclaimer</h4>
              <p>
                Most of our products are hand-woven or hand-crafted. Therefore,
                minor irregularities in weave, color, pattern, or embellishments
                are normal and a hallmark of handmade craftsmanship. Such
                variations are not considered defects but part of the uniqueness
                of each piece.
              </p>
              <p>
                Certain sarees made with traditional hand-block printing may
                show slight fading or color bleeding due to the dyeing and
                printing process used. These characteristics reflect the
                authenticity of handmade textiles.
