                When you make a purchase or interact with our online store, we
                collect personal details such as your name, date of birth,
                contact number, address, and email. We may also collect

                When you provide personal information (to complete a transaction
                or place an order), it implies consent for us to use it for that
                purpose only. If we need it for a secondary reason (like
                marketing), we will ask for your explicit consent or provide a
                way to opt out.

              <h4>Disclosure</h4>
              <p>
                We will not sell, distribute, or disclose your personal
                information to third parties unless required by law or if you

                Our store is hosted on{" "}
                <span className="highlight">Shopify</span>, which provides the
                secure e-commerce platform for our online store. Your data is

              </p>
              <p>
                If you use a direct payment gateway, Shopify encrypts your card
                data using PCI-DSS standards and SSL encryption. Transaction
                data is stored only as long as necessary to complete your order.
              </p>
              <p>
                PCI-DSS compliance ensures secure handling of credit card data

              <h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
              <p>
                Some third-party providers (like payment gateways) collect,
                process, and disclose your information as needed to complete
                transactions. These providers have their own privacy policies,
                and we recommend reviewing them to understand how they handle
                your data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on their location, your information may be subject to
                foreign laws (for example, transactions processed in the U.S.
                may be subject to U.S. legislation like the Patriot Act).

                apply.
